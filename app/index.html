It was a cold Irish summer in 1928 when my grandfather Michael Patrick Connolly decided it was time for him to leave his beautiful County Galway in the west of Ireland and emigrate to America.  With nothing to his name but a few coins in his pocket and a small suitcase, he landed in New York City. After many years as a Seabee in the U.S. Navy, he retired.  In 1950, my grandfather and his wife, Nora, fulfilled their lifelong dreams and opened Connolly's Irish Pub in New York City.  When I reached the age of 21, I decided it was time to follow in my grandfather’sfootsteps and emigrated to pursue my dream of owning an Irish pub in America.  On September 17th , 1988, I said goodbye to my parents and sisters in Ireland.  With a heavy heart, I boarded a one-way flight to the United States  of America. After landing in Washington DC, I went to work for Danny Coleman, owner of the world famous Dubliner Pub . I spent many amazing, fun-filled years managing the Dubliner Pub, and realized I was ready to begin my own adventure.

In 1997, after moving to Raleigh, my partners and I watched our dreams become reality after opening Tir Na Nog Irish Pub in downtown Raleigh . Two years later, we  opened a second location in Cary, known as Connolly's Irish Pub, as a tribute to my grandfather.  After many successful years, I sold my ventures to pursue  the greatest dream of all — starting a beautiful family!
Now that my daughters, Connolly and Dylan, have blossomed into independent young lasses, I find myself missing the old neighborhood pub.  Along with my partners, Donavon and Sami,  we have  pursued this great opportunity to bring Doherty’s Irish Pub & Restaurant to the heart of Cary, NC.  Please be our guest and have a wonderful time at your neighborhood pub! </div>
